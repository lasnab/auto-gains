Start virtual env

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Run your Streamlit app.

```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

If this doesn't work, use the long-form command:

```sh
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

When you're done using this environment, return to your normal shell by typing:

```sh
deactivate
```
